## My process

I opted for desktop first approach this time. As this is an often debated topic online, i wanted to try both approaches when doing these challenges.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I had to research putting svgs as background and how to match the design as close as possible in that regard. The rest was fairly straight forward, it just took some tweeking. I'm not 100% pleased, so I will continue to work on the solution, and plan on adding a dark mode for this challenge.
